# Keenko workspace

A Bun and Nx application workspace created with Keenko.

- `apps/web`: TanStack Start web application.
- `packages/backend`: Convex backend with Confect.
- `packages/ui`: shared UI components and styles.
- `packages/shared`: shared application contracts when needed.

From the workspace root, install dependencies with `bun install` and run `bun run dev` to configure or resume the local Convex deployment and its managed WorkOS AuthKit development environment, then start web and backend development. Convex creates and maintains the untracked root `.env.local`, including a generated AuthKit cookie password; do not create it manually or copy credentials from a dashboard.

A Convex deployment is not required for repository setup or verification. Fresh workspaces can run code generation and `bun run check` without `.env.local`.

Authentication uses WorkOS AuthKit Hosted UI. The public home route links to the sign-in flow, `/protected` demonstrates route protection, and `packages/backend/confect/identity.impl.ts` exposes separate queries for authenticated Convex identity and the official component's synchronized WorkOS infrastructure identity. That synchronized user is not a generated application domain user. See [.keenko/docs/stacks/workos-authkit/README.md](.keenko/docs/stacks/workos-authkit/README.md) for provisioning, webhook, security, and separate auth-smoke verification.

Run `bun run codegen` to regenerate Paraglide, the TanStack Router route tree, and Confect contracts. Fresh creation materializes their required initial state. Run `bun run check` before review: it regenerates in place, fails when tracked generator-owned artifacts drift, and leaves those changes available to review and commit.

Keenko-managed guidance and skills use the Nx sync lifecycle. Run `bun x nx sync` to refresh them, or `bun x nx sync:check` to check for drift without applying changes.

Keep durable project context in [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md). Project-owned architecture, UI decisions, and overrides live in [docs/project](docs/project/), starting with [architecture.md](docs/project/architecture.md).

This README belongs to the project after creation. Edit it as needed; Keenko sync does not overwrite or recreate it.
