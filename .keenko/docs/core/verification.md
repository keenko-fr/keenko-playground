# Verification

## Test philosophy

Prefer observable behavior through the same stable interfaces applications use. Tests should survive persistence/provider refactors.

- Direct data-layer tests are exceptional: index/query semantics, patch encoding, persistence-only invariants, serialization, or defects isolated specifically to persistence.
- Use TDD when behavior can be meaningfully exercised: defects, state transitions, algorithms, contracts, and regressions. Do not force red-green-refactor around generated code, formatting, trivial wiring, or declarative configuration where it adds no value.
- A reproducible bug fix should include regression evidence when practical.
- Test outcomes, persisted state, authorization, rendered behavior, provider requests, and observable side effects rather than internal call counts unless the interaction itself is the contract.
- Mock/fake at genuine external/provider seams; keep real application orchestration behind the seam.
- Do not export private helpers or widen production APIs solely for tests.
- Prefer explicit assertions; use snapshots only when the serialized/rendered structure itself is genuinely the reviewable contract.
- Time/randomness/expiry must be controllable. Avoid real sleeps and wall-clock-dependent tests.
- A flaky test is a defect. Do not hide it permanently with retries, sleeps, widened windows, or skips.
- No global coverage percentage is mandated; meaningful behavior, invariants, failure paths, and changed code matter more.

## Authorization and failure matrices

Security-sensitive interfaces should cover representative caller states (unauthenticated, wrong role, right role, owner/non-owner, expired/revoked where relevant) and adversarial cases such as duplicates, reordering, retries, provider outage, partial failure, invalid input, stale state, and idempotent replay.

## During implementation

Each implementation slice runs the smallest focused verification proving its outcome and reports exactly what ran. Typical evidence includes focused tests, relevant package typecheck, a focused build, or explicit manual/provider verification when genuinely necessary.

For TypeScript changes, format/fix the touched scope and run focused lint/type/tests as appropriate. Safe formatter/linter fixes are implementation tools, not verification evidence until their diff has been inspected.

Manual verification is evidence, not a replacement for automatable behavior tests.

## Merge boundary

Focused checks do not replace the repository's canonical complete verification. Keenko TypeScript repositories expose `bun run check` as the canonical merge-ready aggregate. Its applicable stages run in this conceptual order:

1. `bun x nx sync:check`;
2. other applicable managed-state checks;
3. `format:check`;
4. `lint`;
5. `typecheck`;
6. tests through the root Nx aggregate;
7. builds;
8. project-specific delivery/security checks.

`check` regenerates code in place and leaves tracked generator-owned drift available for review. `bun x nx sync` is the remediation command for Keenko-managed state; `bun x nx sync:check` proves that state was already synchronized.

Generated contract changes require deterministic regeneration verification.

Real-provider staging verification is separate from automated fake/mock integration tests when a provider contract materially matters.

## Consumer GitHub CI

Fresh workspaces include `.github/workflows/check.yml`. Its `Check` job runs on pull requests and pushes to `main`, installs the reference runtimes, performs a frozen install, and delegates verification to `bun run check`. It needs a committed `bun.lock` and current generated source, but no Nx Cloud account or cloud credentials. The workflow grants read-only repository access and does not persist checkout credentials.

To reproduce a failure locally, use the workspace's declared runtimes and run `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, then `bun run check` from the root. Fix failures locally, review the changes, and rerun those commands before pushing through the project's normal review process. For synchronization failures, follow [generated-code recovery](generated-code.md). CI does not repair source.

Project maintainers own the workflow after creation. Add or change verification stages in `package.json`; keep CI delegating to that command. Review action commit updates and branch-trigger changes when maintaining the workflow. Runtime defaults come from Keenko's runtime authority at generation time.

## Reporting and review

Report checks as `passed`, `failed`, `not run`, or `not available`; never infer success from inspection.

After complete verification, use defect-first independent review in a fresh context when practical. Findings must be concrete, introduced by the change, and actionable. Do not manufacture style findings. Human merge approval remains separate.
